Stock Price Prediction using ARIMA and Fourier Transforms

*Project Overview :*

This project explores the prediction of stock trends and prices using a combination of ARIMA models and Fourier Transforms as features. By leveraging both time-series modeling techniques and deep learning, this project aims to create a robust prediction framework for stock prices, integrating traditional statistical models with Fourier transformations for enhanced predictive accuracy.

*Project Structure :*

  - Time-Series Analysis: Utilizes the ARIMA model to capture trends and seasonal patterns in stock data.
  - Feature Engineering with Fourier Transforms: Incorporates Fourier Transforms to add periodic components as features, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex patterns.
  - Model Training: Combines ARIMA and Fourier-transformed features within a deep learning framework for more accurate predictions.
  - Evaluation: Assesses the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy using performance metrics and visualizations.

*Results :*

The notebook provides model performance metrics and visualizations, illustrating the effectiveness of combining ARIMA with Fourier features in stock price prediction. The results demonstrate potential improvements in predictive accuracy over traditional models alone.
